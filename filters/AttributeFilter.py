    An `AttributeFilter` represents the search criteria pattern comparing some

    object satisfies the encoded criterion.

    It is constructed with a comparator operator and a reference value, and
    calling the filter (with __call__) executes `get(approach) OP value` (in
    infix notation).

    Concrete subclasses can override the `get` classmethod to provide custom
    behavior to fetch a desired attribute from the given `CloseApproach`.
